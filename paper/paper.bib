              and discuss the GC skew index (GCSI) for the quantification of
              genomic compositional skew, which combines a normalized measure of
              fast Fourier transform to capture the shape of the skew graph and
              Euclidean distance between the two vertices in a cumulative skew
              graph to represent the degree of skew. We calculated GCSI for all
              available bacterial genomes, and GCSI correlated well with the
              visibility of GC skew. This novel index is useful for estimating
              confidence levels for the prediction of replication origin and
              terminus by methods based on GC skew and for measuring the
              strength of replicational selection in a genome.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Due to their bi-directional replication machinery
              starting from a single finite origin, bacterial genomes show
              characteristic nucleotide compositional bias between the two
              replichores, which can be visualised through GC skew or
              (C-G)/(C+G). Although this polarisation is used for computational
              prediction of replication origins in many bacterial genomes, the
              degree of GC skew visibility varies widely among different
              species, necessitating a quantitative measurement of GC skew
              strength in order to provide confidence measures for GC skew-based
              predictions of replication origins. RESULTS: Here we discuss a
              quantitative index for the measurement of GC skew strength, named
              the generalised GC skew index (gGCSI), which is applicable to
              genomes of any length, including bacterial chromosomes and
              plasmids. We demonstrate that gGCSI is independent of the window
              size and can thus be used to compare genomes with different sizes,
              such as bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. It can suggest the
              existence of different replication mechanisms in archaea and of
              rolling-circle replication in plasmids. Correlation of gGCSI
              values between plasmids and their corresponding host chromosomes
              suggests that within the same strain, these replicons have
              reproduced using the same replication machinery and thus exhibit
              similar strengths of replication strand skew. CONCLUSIONS: gGCSI
              can be applied to genomes of any length and thus allows
              comparative study of replication-related mutation and selection
              pressures in genomes of different lengths such as bacterial
              chromosomes and plasmids. Using gGCSI, we showed that
              replication-related mutation or selection pressure is similar for
              replicons with similar machinery.",
