# Summary
BacterialPloidyPredictor is a Python-based package that batch predicts the bacterial polyploidy based off of global genomic architecture. BacterialPloidyPredictor automates the extraction of features from complete assemblies of bacterial species, and predicts polyploidy by feeding extracted features into pre-trained machine learning models. Besides, the package provides a series of visualizations to help comprehend the difference in global genomic architecture, and estimate the confidence of the prediction. For instance, it visualizes the global genomic features used to predict polyploidy, the place of the sample(s) in the 3-dimentional PCA space generated by training data, and the Euclidean distance to the closest reference point among the distribution formed by reference points. This package serves as the first tool to predict polyploidy in bacteria, helps to explore the biological significance of polyploidy as a prevalent phenotype, and potentiates ploidy quantificstion in the future. 

# Statement of need
Bacterial polyploidy is a To differentiate from the polyploidization during fast growing phase, i.e. mero-polyploidy, such as *E.coli*, polyploidy here is defined as the mantenance of multiple copies of chromosomes at all growing phase.
